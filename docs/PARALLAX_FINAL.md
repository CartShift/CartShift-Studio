# Parallax Effects - Final Implementation

## ✅ Successfully Implemented!

The parallax effects are now working across the CartShift Studio website with subtle, professional animations.

## Adjustments Made

### 1. Parallax Ranges (Tuned for Subtlety)

- **Parallax**: 80px range (was 300px for testing)
- **ParallaxLayer**: 120px range with 2% scale
- Creates visible but not overwhelming movement

### 2. Hero Section - Spread Out Shapes

Adjusted geometric shape positions for better distribution:

- Moved shapes from clustered (10-40%) to spread across viewport (2-95%)
- Shapes now cover the full width and height of the hero section
- Creates better visual balance and depth

### 3. Services Section - Removed Parallax from Icons

- Removed Parallax wrapper from service card icons
- Icons remain static as requested
- Cards still have tilt and hover effects

- ✓ Background orbs (ParallaxLayer with depth)
- ✓ 4 floating geometric shapes (Parallax with varied speeds)
